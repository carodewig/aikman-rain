# Could Troy Aikman throw the ball in the rain?

In the Broncos-Jets game on October 1, Troy Aikamn commented that he always asks quarterbacks how they do in the rain -- because he said he "couldn't throw the ball" when it was wet.

So I decided to figure out if that was true, based on game records and nearby weather data.
